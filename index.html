  <div class="writing2">
    <p>India faces a huge decline in government revenues and growth of the income for at least two quarters as the coronavirus hits economic activity of the country as a whole. A fall in investor sentiment impacts privatization plans, government and industry. <b>Disruption of supply chain and global trade</b> Developing countries like India has more fragile economic and social fabric and the present situation will create more suffering for the unorganizedsectors and migrant labour.</p>

  <div class="heading5">
    <h2>Socially:</h2>

  </div>
  <div1 class="writing3">
    <p>Owing to lockdown and social distancing strategies to combat transmission of viruses have intensified threats of growing domestic violence such as <b>physical, emotional and sexual abuse</b>. The focus on spending time in shutdown ensures that vulnerable people are more marginalized to violence, and it is more complicated for them to look for support. To respond to the increasing concern, the government has to review, how to identify domestic violence, report or wherewith of all service available</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Conclusion:</b>
      <br>
      A <b>comprehensive social-economic development strategy</b> that consists of infrastructure and sector-by-sector schemes that supports business to ensure the success of those with reliable and sustainable business models.
